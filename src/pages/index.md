### Our Students

This course will be intensive, diving into deep programming concepts. There will be times you want to give up.

But press on. Work hard. Put in the time. You'll get out what you put into this course. There is real victory for those who graduate from this course: You'll be employed as Developers!

### Our Pledge

Coding is a craft and I pledge to perform it as such.

I will make my character apparent to those who come behind me.

My code will be ever simpler with a more refined purpose.

I will leave code better than when I found it so that when I or others come back to it, it will not rob us of time, the most precious of things.
