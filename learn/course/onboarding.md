## Accounts

During this course, you'll be using a few different online tools. Let's get some accounts setup:

### GitHub

Create a [GitHub Account](https://github.com).

### Codewars

Create a [Codewars Account](https://www.codewars.com) and set your Codewars Clan to (cAsE-sEnSiTiVe): `TrueCoders`.

## Lightweight Code Editor

There are times where you will want to edit code without all the features of an IDE like Visual Studio.

We recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), but there are other options like [Atom](https://atom.io).

## Source Control

During this course, you'll learn more about Source Control Management. For now, let's just install it so we have it for later.

### Git

Download and install [Git](https://git-scm.com) Source Control Management.

### SourceTree

Download [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com), a Git GUI for Mac and Windows.
