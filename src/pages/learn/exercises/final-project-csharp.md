## Introduction

So, you've reached the end of your C# journey. Congradulations. Now, we give you your biggest challenge yet. A final project that implements everything we've gone over so far.

## Objectives

Our goals in this challenge is to create an ASP.NET Core application, comprised of a public Web API, front end interaction, and backed by a SQL relational database. This app should:

* Implement all CRUD functions on your SQL database
* Deploy a public Web API via. ASP.NET Core
* Deploy a front end web app that interacts with your public Web API

This app also could:

* Interact with/consume other public APIs
* Deal with assets, such as images
* Handle login/registration of user accounts
