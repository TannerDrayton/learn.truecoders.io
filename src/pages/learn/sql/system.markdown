* [MySQL Tools](#mysql-tools)
* [Microsoft SQL Tools](#microsoft-sql-tools)
* [SQL Material](#sql-material)

During this SQL introduction, you'll be using a few different tools:

## MySQL Tools

Download [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/) and configure to install:

* MySQL Workbench
* MySQL Server
* MySQL Shell

Configure as a standalone instance. Setup your server instance as follows:

* Hostname: `localhost`
* Username: `root`
* Password: `password`

Next, download [AdventureWorks database](https://sourceforge.net/projects/awmysql/).

## Microsoft SQL Tools

* [SSMS: SQL Server Management Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms)
* [Microsoft Report Builder](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53613)

"Yes" and "Next" for all installer questions.

Before we do anything, we've got to get connected to a server. Use the following:

* Server: `truecoders.database.windows.net`
* Auth Type: "SQL Server Authentication"
* Username: `developer`
* Password: `4TrueCodersOnly!`

## SQL Material

Now that you're all setup, let's dive into our [SQL Statements](statements.markdown).
