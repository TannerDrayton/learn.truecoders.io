## Accounts

During this course, you'll be using a few different online tools. Let's get some accounts setup:

1. Create a [GitHub Account](https://github.com)
1. Create a [Codewars Account](https://www.codewars.com)
1. Set your Codewars Clan to (cAsE-sEnSiTiVe): `TrueCoders`

## Install Windows on Mac or Linux

If you're **running Windows** already, **feel free to skip this section**.

### VirualBox

Oracle VM VirtualBox is a free, powerful virtualization product allowing you to run multiple operating systems on the same machine. You can [download VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads), but we've uploaded the latest version to the [TrueCoders NAS](https://home.mycloud.com/action/share/d8cacd38-c200-4383-bd75-721a699e2a32). Download and open the VirtualBox Disk Image (.dmg file type) and go through the instructions within.

### Windows 10

We'll need Windows to run Visual Studio IDE, our C# code editor of choice. You can [download Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO) compatible with VirtualBox, but we've uploaded the latest version to the [TrueCoders NAS](https://home.mycloud.com/action/share/d8cacd38-c200-4383-bd75-721a699e2a32). Download and save the file in a good place like your Home folder.

### Install Windows on VirtualBox

This video quickly and accurately describes how to get up and running with Windows and VirtualBox:

## Windows Setup

Before we follow some install steps, here's some suggestions to improve your experience:

* In your File Explorer, select View and select the File name extensions checkbox. This will help you distinguish different file types.

## Visual Studio IDE

Now that you've got your system up and running with Windows, it's time to download Visual Studio IDE. Visual Studio is our IDE of choice for working with C# and .NET. Go ahead and [download Visual Studio IDE (Community Edition)](https://www.visualstudio.com). During the install process, select to install it with:

* .NET Desktop
* .NET Core
* ASP.NET MVC

## ReSharper

Now that you've got Visual Studio installed, you'll want to [download ReSharper by JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper). ReSharper is a Visual Studio Extension for .NET Developers and will really help you as you learn C# and .NET.

## Lightweight Code Editor

There are times where you will want to edit code without all the features of Visual Studio IDE. We recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), but there are other options like [Atom](https://atom.io).

## Source Control

During this course, you'll learn more about Source Control Management. For now, let's just install it so we have it for later. Go ahead and [download Git](https://git-scm.com) Source Control Management as well as [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com), a Git GUI for Mac and Windows.
