## Introduction

Welcome to your continued introduction to programming in this course! We're excited you're here. In this course, we're going to use C# to build an app that talks to you.

Let's say you're tasked with the onboarding experience of an app; let's say it's a banking app. It needs to grab relevant user information while making it fun and simple for the user. You decide to build the onboarding experience using a Console Application that requests user info and stores that info as the user provides it.

## Objectives

Our goals in this challenge is to:

* Interact with a C# project; specifically a console application
* Interact with many different value types and some reference types
* Practice creating an app with the user experience in mind

## App Requirements

Let's build an app that does just that. We'll need our app to grab:

* First and Last Name
* Is Account Owner
* Login Pin Number
* Store in User Class

...All while interacting with the user, storing values that your user passes to you, and communicating successful entry (think `Console.WriteLine()`)

## Challenge

We've talked about different data types. We've shown you how to view documentation. We've demonstrated how to build this application. Now, it's your turn:

1. Build the demo app, duplicating it's functionality
1. Create an empty repository on GitHub
1. Set your app's git remote to be the created repo
1. Push your changes
1. Add your repo's url to the Google Classroom assignment and mark it as complete

**Bonus points:** Error validation and storing more values with the user
